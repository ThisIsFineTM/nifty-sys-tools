# This is just a list of nifty tools that I've been liking for the moment. No rhyme or reason. Just neat stuff.

## Misc tools

### [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger)

> ranger is a console file manager with VI key bindings. It provides a minimalistic and nice curses interface with a view on the directory hierarchy. It ships with rifle, a file launcher that is good at automatically finding out which program to use for what file type.

https://ranger.github.io/

### [pixz](https://github.com/vasi/pixz)

> The existing XZ Utils provide great compression in the .xz file format, but they produce just one big block of compressed data. Pixz instead produces a collection of smaller blocks which makes random access to the original data possible. This is especially useful for large tarballs.

More command-line friendly than 7z and allows for quick individual file extraction.

https://github.com/vasi/pixz/releases

### [zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd)

> Zstandard, or zstd as short version, is a fast lossless compression algorithm, targeting real-time compression scenarios at zlib-level and better compression ratios. 

General purpose compression and my go-to for general use. Good balance between ratio and speed. Currently doesn't have indexing for tar files like what pixz provides.

https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases

Ships with most package managers. Peazip also supports it.

### [zpaq](https://mattmahoney.net/dc/zpaq.html)

> zpaq is a free and open source incremental, journaling command-line archiver for Windows, Linux and Mac OS/X.

If you don't mind waiting a while, `zpaq -m5` can give some bonkers compression ratios that can blow zstd and xz out of the water, but it is *slow*. Good for stuff you want to keep but don't plan on needing quickly.

Ships in fedora's package manager at least.

## Rust-based tools (in vaguely alphabetical order)

### [cargo-install-update](https://github.com/nabijaczleweli/cargo-update)

> AFLTriage is a tool to triage crashing input files using a debugger. It is designed to be portable and not require any run-time dependencies, besides libc and an external debugger. It supports triaging crashes generated by any program, not just AFL, but recognizes AFL directories specially, hence the name.

git clone https://github.com/quic/AFLTriage
cargo install
```

It comes with plenty of configuration options for controlling the search scope and offers many ways of removing duplicates. For maximum flexibility, it integrates well with other Unix utilities like find and it speaks JSON, so you have a lot of control over the search and cleanup process.

```sh
cargo install fclones
```

### [fd-find/fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)

> fd is a program to find entries in your filesystem. It is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find. While it does not aim to support all of find's powerful functionality, it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for a majority of use cases.

```sh
cargo install fd-find
```

### [fend](https://github.com/printfn/fend)

> fend is an arbitrary-precision unit-aware calculator.

```sh

```sh
cargo install hexyl
```

### [httm](https://github.com/kimono-koans/httm)

> httm prints the size, date and corresponding locations of available unique versions (deduplicated by modify time and size) of files residing on snapshots, but can also be used interactively to select and restore files, even snapshot mounts by file! httm might change the way you use snapshots (because ZFS/BTRFS/NILFS2 aren't designed to find unique file versions) or the Time Machine concept (because httm is very fast!).

```sh
cargo install httm
```

### [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine)

> A command-line benchmarking tool.

```sh
cargo install hyperfine
```

```

### [nushell/nu](https://github.com/nushell/nushell)

> Nu draws inspiration from projects like PowerShell, functional programming languages, and modern CLI tools. Rather than thinking of files and data as raw streams of text, Nu looks at each input as something with structure. For example, when you list the contents of a directory what you get back is a table of rows, where each row represents an item in that directory. These values can be piped through a series of steps, in a series of commands called a 'pipeline'.

Everything is a structured query. Has built-in support for lots of data formats. Its like fish, sql, and ipython had a baby.

```sh
cargo install nu
```

### [oxipng](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng)

> Oxipng is a multithreaded lossless PNG/APNG compression optimizer. It can be used via a command-line interface or as a library in other Rust programs.
